This is the home for some Visual Studio plugins that I've written over the years.

## NiftyPerforce ##

> Adds some automation and IDE support for common perforce operations. Since it doesn't query the checkout status of each file in the solution, it's actually much faster than the official perforce scc plugin for Visual Studio. As far as I know this is in wide use in the games industry, at least for sites where they use perforce :)

## NiftySolution ##

> Some handy commands for quickly navigating in a Visual Studio solution, like "open-any-file-in-the-solution" dialog, a toggle header/body file command and build timings.



Both plugins works for Visual Studio 2005/2008/2010/2011.
